Examples for :
- reactive models
- data binding 
- view-model 
- layout taking into account the specifics of mobile devices  
- simple ui animation (reward, spending)
- simple hints
- items list
- localization
- unit tests (I do not recommend writing unit tests for View or Presenters often - but there is such an opportunity)
